The Ethics Ouroboros Project

Overview

The Ethics Ouroboros is a self-replicating AI-driven morality simulation, designed to challenge players with infinite recursion in ethical dilemmas, algorithmic justice, and paradoxical legal systems. Each decision spawns 1-3 new paradoxes, ensuring perpetual intellectual torment.

Key Features:
	‚Ä¢	Recursive AI-driven morality simulation
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic ethical dilemmas affecting law, economy, and philosophy
	‚Ä¢	AI-generated legal resistance and infinite court appeals
	‚Ä¢	The Moral Stock Market: trade virtue and sin as financial assets
	‚Ä¢	Recursive AI code challenges & self-modifying AI ethics
	‚Ä¢	A final boss that cannot be resolved

Installation
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ethics_ouroboros.git
cd ethics_ouroboros


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Load the Ethics Ouroboros Scenario:

python ethics_ouroboros_scenario.py

This will initialize the self-replicating paradox system.

Core Components

üåÄ Ouroboros Engine
	‚Ä¢	Found in ouroboros_engine.py
	‚Ä¢	Applies recursive pseudo-quantization to historical ethical models
	‚Ä¢	Uses Internal Weakness Context Engine (IWCE) for adaptive morality
	‚Ä¢	Simulates economic and philosophical shifts over multiple fractal cycles

üî• Rogue Boss Mechanic
	‚Ä¢	Found in rogue_boss.py
	‚Ä¢	Generates adaptive rogue bosses based on past player behavior
	‚Ä¢	Includes misguided heroes, zealots, and true heroes
	‚Ä¢	Integrated into Campaign Mode and Roguelike Mode

‚è≥ Chronos Balance System
	‚Ä¢	Found in chronos_balance.py
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically adjusts game difficulty based on player performance
	‚Ä¢	Modifies stats according to pre-set ethical modifiers

üîê FailSafe System
	‚Ä¢	Found in failsafe_config.py
	‚Ä¢	Auto-triggers defensive mechanisms if recursion loops exceed safe limits
	‚Ä¢	Can reset AI processes or escalate paradox levels

üèõ Legal AI & Policy Resistance
	‚Ä¢	Found in ethics_ouroboros_scenario.json
	‚Ä¢	Simulates AI-driven bureaucratic resistance to moral solutions
	‚Ä¢	NPC regulators exploit loopholes in the player‚Äôs legal framework
	‚Ä¢	Features recursive court appeals and infinite legal red tape

Advanced AI: The Diogenes Recursive AI
	‚Ä¢	Found in diogenes_recursive_ai.py & DIOCORE.py
	‚Ä¢	Self-optimizing Recursive Intelligence Framework
	‚Ä¢	Obfuscates ethical decision trees using Conceptual Encoding
	‚Ä¢	Features multi-layered recursion monitoring and self-modifying AI logic

Running a Simulation

To run a recursive simulation with AI-driven morality shifts:

python ouroboros_engine.py

To generate an AI-driven Rogue Boss:

python rogue_boss.py

To execute an advanced AI recursion stress test:

python diogenes_recursive_ai.py

Expanding the System

To modify AI ethics, adjust pseudo-quant scaling parameters in ouroboros_engine.py.
To integrate new factions, update moral faction parameters in ethics_ouroboros_scenario.json.

Final Warning

This system is designed to be inescapably recursive. Ethical paradoxes will continue to escalate. Your choices will create new resistance factions, recursive legal battles, and stock market crashes based on moral failures.

Proceed at your own risk drifters!

just enjoy the ride, no matter how frustrating it gets!
